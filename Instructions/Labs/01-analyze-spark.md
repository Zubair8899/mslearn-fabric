# Analyze data with Apache Spark

Apache Spark is an open source engine for distributed data processing, and is widely used to explore, process, and analyze huge volumes of data in data lake storage. Spark is available as a processing option in many data platform products, including Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, and *Trident*. One of the benefits of Spark is support for a wide range of programming languages, including Java, Scala, Python, and SQL; making Spark a very flexible solution for data processing workloads including data cleansing and manipulation, statistical analysis and machine learning, and data analytics and visualization.

This lab will take approximately **45** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need a Power BI Premium subscription with access to the Trident preview.

## Create a workspace

Before working with data in *Trident*, you should create a workspace with support for premium features.

1. Sign into your Power BI service at [https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com).
2. In the menu bar on the left, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks similar to &#128455;).
3. Create a new workspace with a name of your choice, selecting the **Premium per user** licensing mode.
4. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty, as shown here:

    ![Screenshot of an empty workspace in Power BI.](./Images/new-workspace.png)

## Create a lakehouse and upload files

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to switch to the *Data engineering* experience in the portal and create a data lakehouse for the data files you're going to analyze.

1. At the bottom left of the Power BI portal, select the **Power BI** icon and switch to the **Data engineering** experience, as shown here:

    ![Screenshot of the experience menu in Power BI.](./Images/data-engineering.png)

2. In the **Data engineering** home page, create a new **Lakehouse** with a name of your choice (for example, *datalake*).

    After a minute or so, a new lakehouse with no **Tables** or **Files** will be created. You need to ingest some data into the data lakehouse for analysis. There are multiple ways to do this, but in this exercise you'll simply download and extract a folder of text files your local computer and then upload them to your lakehouse.

3. Download and extract the data files for this exercise from [https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/trident-dev/raw/master/Allfiles/Labs/01/orders.zip](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/trident-dev/raw/master/Allfiles/Labs/01/orders.zip).

    > For now, you'll need to sign into GitHub first. When released, the repo will be public!

4. After extracting the zipped archive, verify that you have a folder named **orders** that contains CSV files named **2019.csv**, **2020.csv**, and **2021.csv**.
5. Return to the web browser tab containing your lakehouse, and in the **...** menu for the **Files** collection, select **Upload** and **Upload folder**, and then upload the **orders** folder from your local computer to the lakehouse.
6. After the files have been uploaded, expand **Files** and select the **orders** folder; and verify that the CSV files have been uploaded, as shown here:

    ![Screenshot of uploaded files in a lakehouse.](./Images/uploaded-files.png)

## Create a notebook and load data into a dataframe

To work with data in Apache Spark, you can create a *notebook* and use it to run code that loads the data into a *dataframe*. Spark supports multiple programming languages, but in this exercise you'll use the most commonly used one for data analysis - *PySpark*. PySpark is a variant of Python that is optimized to run on Spark.

1. On the **Home** page while viewing the contents of the **orders** folder in your datalake, in the **Open notebook** menu, select **New notebook**.

    After a few seconds, a new notebook containing a single *cell* will open. Notebooks are made up of one or more cells that can contain *code* or *markdown* (formatted text).

2. With the notebook visible, expand the **Files** list and select the **orders** folder so that the CSV files are listed next to the notebook editor, like this:

    ![Screenshot of a notebook with a Files pane.](./Images/notebook-files.png)

3. In the **...** menu for **2019.csv**, select **Load data** > **Spark**. A new code cell containing the following code should be added to the notebook:

    ```python
    df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","true").load("Files/orders/2019.csv")
    # df now is a Spark DataFrame containing CSV data from "Files/orders/2019.csv".
    display(df)
    ```

4. Use the **&#9655; Run cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.

    > **Note**: Since this is the first time you've run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first run in the session can take a few minutes. Subsequent runs will be quicker.

5. When the cell command has completed, review the output below the cell, which should look similar to this:

    | Index | SO43701 | 11 | 2019-07-01 | Christy Zhu | christy12@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Silver, 44 | 16 | 3399.99 | 271.9992 |
    | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | 1 | SO43704 | 1 | 2019-07-01 | Julio Ruiz | julio1@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Black, 48 | 1 | 3374.99 | 269.9992 |
    | 2 | SO43705 | 1 | 2019-07-01 | Curtis Lu | curtis9@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Silver, 38 | 1 | 3399.99 | 271.9992 |
    | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

    The output shows the rows and columns of data from the 2019.csv file. However, note that the column headers don't look right. The defualt code used to load the data into a dataframe assumed that the CSV file included the column names in the first row, but in this case the CSV file just includes the data with no header information.

6. Modify the code to set the **header** option to **false** as follows:

    ```python
    df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","false").load("Files/orders/2019.csv")
    # df now is a Spark DataFrame containing CSV data from "Files/orders/2019.csv".
    display(df)
    ```

7. Re-run the cell and review the output, which should look similar to this:

   | Index | _c0 | _c1 | _c2 | _c3 | _c4 | _c5 | _c6 | _c7 | _c8 |
    | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | 1 | SO43701 | 11 | 2019-07-01 | Christy Zhu | christy12@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Silver, 44 | 16 | 3399.99 | 271.9992 |
    | 2 | SO43704 | 1 | 2019-07-01 | Julio Ruiz | julio1@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Black, 48 | 1 | 3374.99 | 269.9992 |
    | 3 | SO43705 | 1 | 2019-07-01 | Curtis Lu | curtis9@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Silver, 38 | 1 | 3399.99 | 271.9992 |
    | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

    Now the dataframe correctly includes first row as data values, but the column names are auto-generated and not very helpful. To make sense of the data, you need to explicitly define the correct schema for the data values in the file.

8. Modify the code as follows to define a schema and apply it when loading the data:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.types import *
    from pyspark.sql.functions import *

    orderSchema = StructType([
        StructField("SalesOrderNumber", StringType()),
        StructField("SalesOrderLineNumber", IntegerType()),
        StructField("OrderDate", DateType()),
        StructField("CustomerName", StringType()),
        StructField("Email", StringType()),
        StructField("Item", StringType()),
        StructField("Quantity", IntegerType()),
        StructField("UnitPrice", FloatType()),
        StructField("Tax", FloatType())
        ])

    df = spark.read.format("csv").schema(orderSchema).load("Files/orders/2019.csv")
    display(df)
    ```

9. Run the modified cell and review the output, which should look similar to this:

   | Index | SalesOrderNumber | SalesOrderLineNumber | OrderDate | CustomerName | Email | Item | Quantity | UnitPrice | Tax |
    | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | 1 | SO43701 | 11 | 2019-07-01 | Christy Zhu | christy12@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Silver, 44 | 16 | 3399.99 | 271.9992 |
    | 2 | SO43704 | 1 | 2019-07-01 | Julio Ruiz | julio1@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Black, 48 | 1 | 3374.99 | 269.9992 |
    | 3 | SO43705 | 1 | 2019-07-01 | Curtis Lu | curtis9@adventure-works.com | Mountain-100 Silver, 38 | 1 | 3399.99 | 271.9992 |
    | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

    Now the dataframe includes the correct column names and data types as defined by the schema (in addition to the **Index**, which is a built-in column in all dataframes based on the ordinal position of each row).

10. The dataframe includes only the data from the **2019.csv** file. Modify the code as follows to read the sales order data from all of the files in the **orders** folder:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.types import *
    from pyspark.sql.functions import *

    orderSchema = StructType([
        StructField("SalesOrderNumber", StringType()),
        StructField("SalesOrderLineNumber", IntegerType()),
        StructField("OrderDate", DateType()),
        StructField("CustomerName", StringType()),
        StructField("Email", StringType()),
        StructField("Item", StringType()),
        StructField("Quantity", IntegerType()),
        StructField("UnitPrice", FloatType()),
        StructField("Tax", FloatType())
        ])

    df = spark.read.format("csv").schema(orderSchema).load("Files/orders/*.csv")
    display(df)
    ```

11. Run the modified code cell and review the output, which should now include sales for 2019, 2020, and 2021.

    **Note**: Only a subset of thr rows are displayed, so you may not be able to see examples from all years.

## Analyze data in a dataframe

The **dataframe** object in Spark is similar to a Pandas dataframe in Python, and includes a wide range of functions that you can use to manipulate, filter, group, and otherwise analyze the data it contains.

### Filter a dataframe

1. Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it.

    ```Python
    customers = df['CustomerName', 'Email']
    print(customers.count())
    print(customers.distinct().count())
    display(customers.distinct())
    ```

2. Run the new code cell, and review the results. Observe the following details:
    - When you perform an operation on a dataframe, the result is a new dataframe (in this case, a new **customers** dataframe is created by selecting a specific subset of columns from the **df** dataframe)
    - Dataframes provide functions such as **count** and **distinct** that can be used to summarize and filter the data they contain.
    - The `dataframe['Field1', 'Field2', ...]` syntax is a shorthand way of defining a subset of column. You can also use **select** method, so the first line of the code above could be written as `customers = df.select("CustomerName", "Email")`

3. Modify the code as follows:

    ```Python
    customers = df.select("CustomerName", "Email").where(df['Item']=='Road-250 Red, 52')
    print(customers.count())
    print(customers.distinct().count())
    display(customers.distinct())
    ```

4. Run the modified code to view the customers who have purchased the *Road-250 Red, 52* product. Note that you can "chain" multiple functions together so that the output of one function becomes the input for the next - in this case, the dataframe created by the **select** method is the source dataframe for the **where** method that is used to apply filtering criteria.

### Aggregate and group data in a dataframe

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```Python
    productSales = df.select("Item", "Quantity").groupBy("Item").sum()
    display(productSales)
    ```

2. Run the code cell you added, and note that the results show the sum of order quantities grouped by product. The **groupBy** method groups the rows by *Item*, and the subsequent **sum** aggregate function is applied to all of the remaining numeric columns (in this case, *Quantity*)

3. Add another new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```Python
    yearlySales = df.select(year("OrderDate").alias("Year")).groupBy("Year").count().orderBy("Year")
    display(yearlySales)
    ```

4. Run the code cell you added, and note that the results show the number of sales orders per year. Note that the **select** method includes a SQL **year** function to extract the year component of the *OrderDate* field, and then an **alias** method is used to assign a columm name to the extracted year value. The data is then grouped by the derived *Year* column and the count of rows in each group is calculated before finally the **orderBy** method is used to sort the resulting dataframe.

## Query data using Spark SQL

As you've seen, the native methods of the dataframe object enable you to query and analyze data quite effectively. However, many data analysts are more comfortable working with SQL syntax. Spark SQL is a SQL language API in Spark that you can use to run SQL statements, or even persist data in relational tables.

### Use Spark SQL in PySpark code

The default language in Azure Synapse Studio notebooks is PySpark, which is a Spark-based Python runtime. Within this runtime, you can use the **spark.sql** library to embed Spark SQL syntax within your Python code, and work with SQL constructs such as tables and views.

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```Python
    df.createOrReplaceTempView("salesorders")

    spark_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM salesorders")
    display(spark_df)
    ```

2. Run the cell and review the results. Observe that:
    - The code persists the data in the **df** dataframe as a temporary view named **salesorders**. Spark SQL supports the use of temporary views or persisted tables as sources for SQL queries.
    - The **spark.sql** method is then used to run a SQL query against the **salesorders** view.
    - The results of the query are stored in a dataframe.

### Run SQL code in a cell

While it's useful to be able to embed SQL statements into a cell containing PySpark code, data analysts often just want to work directly in SQL.

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```sql
    %%sql
    SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
           SUM((UnitPrice * Quantity) + Tax) AS GrossRevenue
    FROM salesorders
    GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)
    ORDER BY OrderYear;
    ```

2. Run the cell and review the results. Observe that:
    - The `%%sql` line at the beginning of the cell (called a *magic*) indicates that the Spark SQL language runtime should be used to run the code in this cell instead of PySpark.
    - The SQL code references the **salesorder** view that you created previously using PySpark.
    - The output from the SQL query is automatically displayed as the result under the cell.

> **Note**: For more information about Spark SQL and dataframes, see the [Spark SQL documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/sql-programming-guide.html).

## Visualize data with Spark

A picture is proverbially worth a thousand words, and a chart is often better than a thousand rows of data. While notebooks in Azure Synapse Analytics include a built in chart view for data that is displayed from a dataframe or Spark SQL query, it is not designed for comprehensive charting. However, you can use Python graphics libraries like **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to create charts from data in dataframes.

### View results as a chart

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```sql
    %%sql
    SELECT * FROM salesorders
    ```

2. Run the code and observe that it returns the data from the **salesorders** view you created previously.
3. In the results section beneath the cell, change the **View** option from **Table** to **Chart**.
4. Use the **View options** button at the top right of the chart to display the options pane for the chart. Then set the options as follows and select **Apply**:
    - **Chart type**: Bar chart
    - **Key**: Item
    - **Values**: Quantity
    - **Series Group**: *leave blank*
    - **Aggregation**: Sum
    - **Stacked**: *Unselected*

5. Verify that the chart looks similar to this:

    ![Screenshot of a bar chart of products by total order quantiies](./Images/notebook-chart.png)

### Get started with **matplotlib**

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```Python
    sqlQuery = "SELECT CAST(YEAR(OrderDate) AS CHAR(4)) AS OrderYear, \
                    SUM((UnitPrice * Quantity) + Tax) AS GrossRevenue \
                FROM salesorders \
                GROUP BY CAST(YEAR(OrderDate) AS CHAR(4)) \
                ORDER BY OrderYear"
    df_spark = spark.sql(sqlQuery)
    df_spark.show()
    ```

2. Run the code and observe that it returns a Spark dataframe containing the yearly revenue.

    To visualize the data as a chart, we'll start by using the **matplotlib** Python library. This library is the core plotting library on which many others are based, and provides a great deal of flexibility in creating charts.

3. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and add the following code to it:

    ```Python
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    # matplotlib requires a Pandas dataframe, not a Spark one
    df_sales = df_spark.toPandas()

    # Create a bar plot of revenue by year
    plt.bar(x=df_sales['OrderYear'], height=df_sales['GrossRevenue'])

    # Display the plot
    plt.show()
    ```

4. Run the cell and review the results, which consist of a column chart with the total gross revenue for each year. Note the following features of the code used to produce this chart:
    - The **matplotlib** library requires a *Pandas* dataframe, so you need to convert the *Spark* dataframe returned by the Spark SQL query to this format.
    - At the core of the **matplotlib** library is the **pyplot** object. This is the foundation for most plotting functionality.
    - The default settings result in a usable chart, but there's considerable scope to customize it

5. Modify the code to plot the chart as follows:

    ```Python
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    # Clear the plot area
    plt.clf()

    # Create a bar plot of revenue by year
    plt.bar(x=df_sales['OrderYear'], height=df_sales['GrossRevenue'], color='orange')

    # Customize the chart
    plt.title('Revenue by Year')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Revenue')
    plt.grid(color='#95a5a6', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, axis='y', alpha=0.7)
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)

    # Show the figure
    plt.show()
    ```

6. Re-run the code cell and view the results. The chart now includes a little more information.

    A plot is technically contained with a **Figure**. In the previous examples, the figure was created implicitly for you; but you can create it explicitly.

7. Modify the code to plot the chart as follows:

    ```Python
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    # Clear the plot area
    plt.clf()

    # Create a Figure
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,3))

    # Create a bar plot of revenue by year
    plt.bar(x=df_sales['OrderYear'], height=df_sales['GrossRevenue'], color='orange')

    # Customize the chart
    plt.title('Revenue by Year')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Revenue')
    plt.grid(color='#95a5a6', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, axis='y', alpha=0.7)
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)

    # Show the figure
    plt.show()
    ```

8. Re-run the code cell and view the results. The figure determines the shape and size of the plot.

    A figure can contain multiple subplots, each on its own *axis*.

9. Modify the code to plot the chart as follows:

    ```Python
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    # Clear the plot area
    plt.clf()

    # Create a figure for 2 subplots (1 row, 2 columns)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (10,4))

    # Create a bar plot of revenue by year on the first axis
    ax[0].bar(x=df_sales['OrderYear'], height=df_sales['GrossRevenue'], color='orange')
    ax[0].set_title('Revenue by Year')

    # Create a pie chart of yearly order counts on the second axis
    yearly_counts = df_sales['OrderYear'].value_counts()
    ax[1].pie(yearly_counts)
    ax[1].set_title('Orders per Year')
    ax[1].legend(yearly_counts.keys().tolist())

    # Add a title to the Figure
    fig.suptitle('Sales Data')

    # Show the figure
    plt.show()
    ```

10. Re-run the code cell and view the results. The figure contains the subplots specified in the code.

> **Note**: To learn more about plotting with matplotlib, see the [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/).

### Use the **seaborn** library

While **matplotlib** enables you to create complex charts of multiple types, it can require some complex code to achieve the best results. For this reason, over the years, many new libraries have been built on the base of matplotlib to abstract its complexity and enhance its capabilities. One such library is **seaborn**.

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:

    ```Python
    import seaborn as sns

    # Clear the plot area
    plt.clf()

    # Create a bar chart
    ax = sns.barplot(x="OrderYear", y="GrossRevenue", data=df_sales)
    plt.show()
    ```

2. Run the code and observe that it displays a bar chart using the seaborn library.
3. Modify the code as follows:

    ```Python
    import seaborn as sns

    # Clear the plot area
    plt.clf()

    # Set the visual theme for seaborn
    sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")

    # Create a bar chart
    ax = sns.barplot(x="OrderYear", y="GrossRevenue", data=df_sales)
    plt.show()
    ```

4. Run the modified code and note that seaborn enables you to set a consistent color theme for your plots.

5. Modify the code again as follows:

    ```Python
    import seaborn as sns

    # Clear the plot area
    plt.clf()

    # Create a bar chart
    ax = sns.lineplot(x="OrderYear", y="GrossRevenue", data=df_sales)
    plt.show()
    ```

6. Run the modified code to view the yearly revenue as a line chart.

> **Note**: To learn more about plotting with seaborn, see the [seaborn documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).

## Save the notebook and end the Spark session

Now that you've finished working with the data, you can save the notebook with a meaningful name and end the Spark session.

1. In the notebook menu bar, use the ⚙️ **Settings** icon to view the notebook settings.
2. Set the **Name** of the notebook to **Analyze Orders**, and then close the settings pane.
3. On the notebook menu, select **Stop session** to end the Spark session.
